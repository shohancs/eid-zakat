                    <p><strong>Zakat</strong> charity is only for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer it, and those whose hearts are made to incline (to truth), and (to free) the captives, and those in debt, and in the way of Allah and for the wayfarer -- an ordinance from Allah. And Allah is Knowing, Wise.</p>

                    <p>Daily prayers are the best medium through which one can Seek the nearness to Allah. Hajj is Jihad for every weak person. For everything that you own there is <strong>Zakat</strong>, and <strong>Zakat</strong> of your body is fasting. The Jihad of a woman is to afford pleasant company to her husband.</p>
